## Hi 👋, I'm Othmane

I'm a software developer in France working with Java EE who loves to craft web application as a hobby.

I currently work with Java and witgh with Jenkins for some CI/CD for the most part, but I'm also very interested in the Javascript environment : Typescript, React, Angular and so on.

💼 I'm working for a french company : Atos as a Software engineer.

👨‍💻 I'm always crafting apps with different technologies as side projects to improve my dev skills.
